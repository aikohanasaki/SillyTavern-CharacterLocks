## [3.1.0] - 2025-01-16

### Added
- **Enhanced Event Management System**: Comprehensive event handler registration and cleanup system with proper resource management

- **Error Recovery**: Added comprehensive error boundaries with detailed logging and recovery mechanisms
- **Event System Robustness**: Enhanced event registration with validation, cleanup, and fallback handling
